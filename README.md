**Note**: Work in Progress

Are you ever found yourself wondering at which level you should recruit Coran to keep his pointy ears from wasting his precious thieving points on Pick Pockets?  

Or maybe you don't wanna miss out on Haer'Dalis long sword specialisation available only if you recruit him after level 15?  
So sweet and forbidden.  

Or maybe you are doing [Master of all Skills Arcanum walkthrough]([https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=818649577) and need to know at which levels Jayna Styles opens up her shop with her amazing herbal remedies?  

Maybe you just a little bit confused or even depressed in front of various game editions and miriads of opinionated fixpacks changing your potential followers, making it difficult to track the effective values via dozens wiki pages and obsolete guides?

Well then, this simple application intends to help you plan your ideal walkthrough of Baldur's Gate, Arcanum or Neverwinter Nights by providing full dossier on each and every possible follower, including their leveling scheme for all popular versions and fixpacks!
